subtitle: Me and my cats helping cardano with decentralization
---

I am Nadiem from the Netherlands and I am the operator of the Lucy Pool. The name Lucy comes from one of my cats, since cats will eeventatlly rule the world ;) it is my task to keep the Cardano ecosystem running for the many decades to come. Our journey began with a video and we have been following the Cardano Project since late 2017. Since then the decentralization has taken off and we decided to start a running a pool for the coin that I see going places. Today my cats and I operate the Stake Pool with a lot of love and passion ❤️
