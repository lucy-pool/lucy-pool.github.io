The pool is run off three reliable, redundant virtual private servers, one block producer and two relays distributed across different data centers in Europe. With this redundant setup, Lucy pool will never miss a block even during maintenance windows.

All nodes run on a modern secure Server OS with ample hardware resources and the setup is scaleble to meet rising demands if need be.

I do not want to bore you with elaborate real-time monitoring data of my pool(maybe i will a a later time), you can just expect that the pool works for you 24/7.
